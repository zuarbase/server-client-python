Use the Tableau Server Client (TSC) library to increase your productivity as you interact with the Tableau Server REST API. With the TSC library you can do almost everything that you can do with the REST API, including:

* Publish workbooks and data sources.
* Create users and groups.
* Query projects, sites, and more.

This repository contains Python source code and sample files. Python versions 3.6 and up are supported.
